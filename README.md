# About this Skill
Now you can have access to GIPHY’s vast collection of GIFs, and have them delivered right to your mobile phone.

To get started … just say, “Alexa, open gif guru”, to quickly link your mobile phone number. It’s a quick, one-time process, and all you need is your voice.

Like Alexa, GIF Guru is intelligent and understands a lot of things. Here’s some example phrases gif guru would understand:

*“Alexa, ask gif guru to find me a gif about LeBron James”*

*“Alexa, tell gif guru to send me something about Ariana Grande”*

*“Alexa, open gif guru and search for Game of Thrones”*

From there, you’ll get a text containing a few GIF’s based on what you asked for.

Have fun and remember, Alexa pronounces GIF with a hard G ;)
